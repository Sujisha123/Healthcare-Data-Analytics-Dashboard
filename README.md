# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes patient healthcare data to uncover insights related to **treatment cost**, **length of stay**, and **patient satisfaction levels**.  
The goal is to help healthcare stakeholders make **data-driven decisions** to improve patient outcomes and resource efficiency.

## 📌 Key Objectives
- Understand how **age, condition, and procedure types** affect patient care outcomes.
- Compare **cost of treatments** across conditions.
- Evaluate **patient satisfaction** and readmission patterns.
- Create an **interactive dashboard** for hospital decision-making.
